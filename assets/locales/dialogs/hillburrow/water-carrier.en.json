If I had to summarize my life so far, I'd say it's all about ponies, ponies who offered a hoof to me when I was alone, and it's a bit curious to think that chance forges destiny, because when you love something being well done, the nice gestures, sometimes you don't find the proper partner, the mirror that helps you move forward, and it wasn't my case, as I was saying, because on the contrary I was able to, and I thank life for that, I'm singing life, I'm dancing life, I am only love, and lastly when ponies ask me \"but where do you find that humanity\", well I answer to them in all simplicity that it comes from my taste for love, that taste which pushed me to carry water today, but tomorrow, who knows, to give myself to my family through the gift of myself.",
