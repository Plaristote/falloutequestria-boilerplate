            "ask-about-job": "You wanted to speak with me ?",
            "councilMeeting/entry": "We've got a visitor.<br>\nYou're well known around here, by now. And respected.\nTell me, stranger… or should I say, honorary citizen of Thornhoof…\ndid you come to bring us help once again ?",
            "councilMeeting/heroic-reaction": "It is good to tread with ponies driven by morality. That is a rare and precious sight. I do hope however that your good will shall persist against the trials that we're about to face.",
            "councilMeeting/mercenary-reaction": "The idealists at this table might not appreciate your pragmatism. But I believe that there is no stronger loyalty bond than money. And our coffers are filled with the riches that the Golden Herd would steal from us.\n<br><br>\nHelp this city in its time of needs, and you will be granted your fair share.",
            "councilMeeting/pacifist-reaction": "That's… unsettling. The situation doesn't seem morally gray to me. The Golden Herd is waging war against us. We are the ones who are trapped behind walls. They're besieging us, after having destroyed our neighbor's home, Basalburg. The refugees we generously welcomed are proof of that. What is there left to ponder, I wonder…",
            "councilMeeting/quest-intro": "Very well. Regardless, we need you. Rime Leaf thinks you could help her solve a matter of public security.\n<br><br>\nAnd I too, wish to talk with you. Face to face. These matters shouldn't be discussed publicly. You may meet us later, our offices are upstairs.",
            "councilMeeting/sarcasm-reaction": "Outsider, this is a serious matter. Hundreds of lives are at stake.",
            "lab-quest/A1": "I don't get it. If it's such a secretive topic, why me ?",
            "lab-quest/A2": "Darn. So, what am I looking for this time ?",
            "lab-quest/A3": "The Ministry of Arcane Science ? What's that ?",
            "lab-quest/A4": "Why can't you do it yourself, then ?",
            "lab-quest/accept": "Alright. I'll do it.",
            "lab-quest/accept-extra-A1": "Sure thing, boss !",
            "lab-quest/accept-extra-A2": "I see. I guess it's best for me not to get invovled too much, right ?",
            "lab-quest/accept-extra-A3": "Alright. I'll trust you.",
            "lab-quest/accept-extra-A4": "I don't really think you have a choice.",
            "lab-quest/accept-extra-A5": "Looks like I don't have a choice either. I'll do it.",
            "lab-quest/extra-task-ask": "What will that do ?",
            "lab-quest/negociate": "Sounds interseting. But I don't work for free.",
            "lab-quest/question-extra-A1": "Not unless you tell me what this is about. I need to know what I'm getting into.",
            "lab-quest/question-extra-A2": "Data threatening to whom ? What are you talking about ? How do you even know all this ?",
            "lab-quest/question-extra-A3": "So, is this the real reason why you want this task to be done secretely, outside of the council's attention ?",
            "lab-quest/question-extra-A4": "You've been there, haven't you ? That's how you know all this. Did you use to work there ? And now, you want me to clean up your secrets ?",
            "lab-quest/reject": "I'll have to think about it.",
            "meeting-heroic-1": "I'm here to help. I won't let you down.",
            "meeting-mercenary-1": "As long as the reward is worth it, you'll have my support.",
            "meeting-pacifist-1": "I'm here as an observer. I cannot take a decision right now.",
            "meeting-sarcasm-1": "As much as I like the \"damsel in distress\" trope, you're not really my type.",
            "office-exit-entry": "Just going through.",
            "officeMeeting/entry": "Good day. What can I do for you ?",
            "officeMeeting/lab-quest/accepted": "Outsanding. <i>He gives you an access card</i>.<br>You'll need this to get in the laboratory. A guard will stop you at the entrance. Tell them you're the new cleaning pony. He'll let you go through.",
            "officeMeeting/lab-quest/extra/intro": "It's important, and you need to do it. Can I count on you ?",
            "officeMeeting/lab-quest/extra/intro-confess-1": "Yes. Yes, I used to work there. I was a researcher. The people down there… the ghouls… they were my colleagues. My friends, some of them at least. It's too late for them, or me. That's how I know that whatever's down there must never make it back to the surface.\n<br><br>\nListen to me. You must destroy the data. All of it. In your best interest, I advise you not to even try to look at any of it. Nothing good will come out of it. Nothing. I will trust you with this task. I hope you can trust me as well.",
            "officeMeeting/lab-quest/extra/intro-confess-2": "Yeah. You're right. I'm cornered. But I didn't come this far by giving up when the going gets rough. So, will you help me ?",
            "officeMeeting/lab-quest/extra/intro-council": "It is one of the reason why I want this done quietly, yes. I cannot allow just anypony to learn about what's down there.",
            "officeMeeting/lab-quest/extra/intro-explain": "I don't know if it's a good idea to tell you. There's data, in that computer, that could threaten the livelihood of Thornhoof, and perhaps even more than that. It's very dangerous. That holodisk will run a program that will wipe that data. It's for the best.",
            "officeMeeting/lab-quest/extra/intro-pressed": "I can't say more… you must trust me. I'm only trying to protect this town.",
            "officeMeeting/lab-quest/intro": "Yes. You proved yourself trustworthy. I have a confidential mission I'd like to entrust to you. What we're about to discuss must remain between these walls.\n<br><br>\nWe built Thornhoof above a pre-war facility. In its underground, there was a laboratory ran by the Ministry of Arcane Science. It's located towards the West after the town's entrance. Inside, there's a device that could save this town.",
            "officeMeeting/lab-quest/intro-end": "Thank you. I'm relying on you. Come bck when you're done. Don't forget: fetch the inverted flux battery, and plug the holodisk in the computer of the control room.",
            "officeMeeting/lab-quest/intro-explain-choice": "That's just it. As a foreigner, you are bound to none of the factions here. What I'm asking you requires a bit of… duplicity, towards the other gardians of Thornhoof.<br>\nThe council knows about this device and its whereabouts, but so do the Steel Rangers. There are already plans to organize a recovery team. I want to act before the council and outside of its field of view, so no faction can try to interfere and intercept the device.",
            "officeMeeting/lab-quest/intro-explain-dangers": "If it wasn't dangerous, then it'd already be done.<br><br>\nThe hallways are infested with feral gouls. Even without accounting for those, it's not exactly a safe place. Not everyone would be able to overcome this place. But I think you have what it takes.",
            "officeMeeting/lab-quest/intro-explain-device": "You must retrieve an experimental device, an inverted flux battery.<br>\nIt's located in a storage room, within the second level of the underground laboratory. Can I trust you with this mission ?",
            "officeMeeting/lab-quest/intro-explain-maos": "Have you heard of Twilight Sparkle ? Blablablabla.",
            "officeMeeting/lab-quest/intro-extra": "There's something else I need you to do down there. There's a computer, in the laboratory's control room. I want you to plug this holodisk in it. It's very important.",
            "officeMeeting/not-ready": "Yes. I have high hopes that, with your cooperation, we might just be able to get this town out of this precarious situation.\n<br><br>\nI have a mission to task you with. But before that, I'd like to see how you work. Councilmare Rime Leaf works in the office right next to mine, and she has tasks for you regarding the security of our walls. They will test your loyalty to us, and if you show yourself able to take the harsh decisions that a situation might require, I will then trust you with a task of the utmost importance.\n<br><br>\nThank you for coming by.",
            "report-lab-quest": "I have that device you wanted from the laboratory."
