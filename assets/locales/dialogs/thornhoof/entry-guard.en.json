            "about-town": "You've reached Thornhoof. A city of the heights, a stronghold who's been holding against the Golden Herd for many moons.<br>\nAnd if you're still alive... well, that means you either work for them, or you could be useful working for us.",

            "no-getting-away": "No. You come with us, and you meet Silvertide. I know it looks like I'm asking, but that's just because I'm polite. Truth is, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.",
            "on-go-to-meeting": "Good lad. Lead the way, Silvertide's office is that way.",

            "whats-happening": "Are you for real ? The town is surrounded. Did you just waltz on past our assailants without noticing ?\n<br><br>\nNo more caravans, no reinforcements. Raiders encircling us and yelling day and night, hoping we either starve or surrender.\n<br><br>\nIf Silvertide thinks you've got a role to play, then you're going to listen to her."
