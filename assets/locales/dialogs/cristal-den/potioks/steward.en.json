            "about-potioks-rumors": "Of course. The weak always whisper unpleasing comments about those that surpass them. It is not a shame to be powerful.",

            "recruitment/success": "That's promising. Get down inside the bunker, and introduce yourself to Daisy. She's The Matriarch secretary. Tell her you're applying for the intel job.",
            "send-away": "Oh no you're not ! You're not allowed past this room. If you've got nothing to ask me, then scram."
