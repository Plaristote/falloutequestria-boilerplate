            "about-location": "It’s Unhaus. It’s my town – a large building. It’s safe, got food, got community, everything you’d need. Visitors say it’s strange. I wouldn’t know, I grew up here. We had rows of hanged raiders around here back when I was a foal, to scare off raiders. But the mayor wanted to be more open to caravans. So, that’s probably why ponies find it spooky. Their spirits linger.",

            "changeling-ans-danger": "Yes. They control the town!",
            "changeling-ans-evasive": "Forget I said anything.",
            "changeling-ans-explain": "They are insect ponies, that take the appearance of ponies, and they eat love.",
            "changeling-ans-safe": "No, they aren’t.",

            "meeting-quest-ans-insects": "I’m looking for insect ponies.",
