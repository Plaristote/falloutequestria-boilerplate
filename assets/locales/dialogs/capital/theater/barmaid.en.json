            "about-bar": "There is no civilization without a place to gather after a long day.\n<br><br>\nWhen I joined Ashaven, this building was in ruins. But <b>Wailing Tune</b> and I saw what it could become. She needed a place to sing, and I needed a place to... bring some order to the chaos.",
            "about-bar-ask-singer": "Wailing Tunes... is that the name of this singer ?",
            "about-cadence": "I didn't know her well. I just served her. But she...\n<br><br>\nNo description would do her justice. She was more than a queen. She lit up every place she went, and her kindness was contagious.",
            "about-npc": "I used to serve at Cadence Castle. Afternoon tea, state banquets... then it all fell apart.",
            "about-npc-more": "I wandered the wasteland, searching for a home. Crystal Den was a nightmare... the slavery, the brutality. The people there don't even know what 'thank you' means.\n<br><br>\nSo, I turned back. And in the ruins, I found a voice. Wailing Tune.\n<br><br>\nEven amidst the ruins and the silence, it still sang.\n<br><br>\n<i>She looks dreamily at Wailing Tune, who is singing on the other side of the bar.</i>",

            "ghoul-love-sure-about-suspicions": "Whispering Ash? Are you sure this is more than friendship ?",
            "goul-love/feelings-confirmed": "Damn... after all these years, and it took a snooping smoothskin to make me find out.\n<br><br>\nOkay... okay. I'll have to... think about all this. But thanks, I guess.\n<br><br>\nAnd most importantly, keep it to yourself now, okay? I have my pride.",
            "goul-love/feelings-confirmed-and-encouraged": "Talk to her, huh? Like it's that simple...\n<br><br>\nMaybe... Maybe I should. After all, it's not like we have eternity ahead of us...\n<br><br>\nYou're the type to get involved in everything, aren't you? You must get along well with Broken Lens! But hey... maybe this time it wasn't such a bad idea.",
            "goul-love/feelings-revealed": "She... does she love me too?\n<br><br>\nBy Celestia, I said I didn't want any indiscretions... and here you come with this!\n<br><br>\nI should be furious that you went snooping... but how could I be?\n<br><br>\nAre you sure about that? Did she tell you in person?",

            "goul-love/investigated-entry": "Yes ? What's happening ?",
            "goul-love/investigation-suggested": "No! Well... no. It's ridiculous. She doesn't need to know I'm asking myself these kinds of questions.\n<br><br>\nIf she wants to talk to me about her feelings, she will. I'm not going to pry into her life.",
            "goul-love/suspicions": "I don't know. But... she spends a lot of time with Whispering Ash.\n<br><br>\nThey have late-night talks, knowing silences... There's something between them, I'm sure of it.\n<br><br>\nAnd look at him. A former royal agent, mysterious, cultured, with a deep voice... How could I compete with that?",
            "introduction": "Welcome to The Last Act. Here, courtesy is required, even at the ends of the earth. Sit down. What can I get you?",

            "singer-disrespected": "You smoothskin people can't understand.\n<br><br>\nWe've seen centuries pass, we've lost more than you can imagine. His voice soothes our scars.\n<br><br>\nIf that bothers you... no one's forcing you to stay.",
            "start-love-route": "You stayed for her, didn't you ?",
