Fortunately, the concentrations were low and the effects were limited to a few transient blackouts.\n<br><br>\nHowever, this leak highlights a concerning failure of the MRA. It is surprising that a component, designed by Stable-Tec to operate continuously for hundreds of years, should show such deterioration after such a short time of use. The exact nature of this degradation does not match the wear predicted by the data sheets. Something is happening that we don't yet understand, and we'll have to be vigilant to figure out what it is.\n<br><br>\nFrom now on, increased monitoring of the atmospheric system will be implemented. I recommend that we always keep at least one spare M.R.M.A. in stock, ideally directly in the control room on the 3rd basement, so that the part can be replaced quickly, in the event of a new emergency situation.
