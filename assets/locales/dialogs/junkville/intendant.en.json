Rathian, who lives in the workshop in front of here, has entire crate of electronical devices... but we can't get him to share these resources. A Steel Ranger thing, probably, they don't like sharing tech.<br><br>\nIf you get me a crate of electronical devices, I will be able to sell it to the caraveneers, and buy back the supplies the diamond dogs want from us.",
