            "dogs-battle-ask-reward-fail": "No. I value my comrade's life above all else, but I seriously doubt your help will be worth that much caps. I'll pay you a hundred and that's final. So, are we going ?",
            "dogs-battle-ask-reward-improved": "Okay. 200 caps it is. But you better make yourself worth it.",
            "dogs-battle-canceled": "Really ? That's good news, I guess… it's a pity for those diamond dogs. But at least we no longer face impending doom, so… thank you !",

            "dogs-battle-peacemaking-appeased": "When you put it like that… I guess I don't really want this town's history tainted with blood. This place should be about building a confortable future… we'll probably regret building it on the mistakes of the past. Ok. We won't attack them. Still, I'll see if we can start some kind of night patrol or something… we can't drop our guard.",

You would be slaughtering an entire village, on the chance that they might slaugther you first. I'm guessing that might be all this whole megaspell hellhole around us started in the first place… maybe it's time to start trusting that good things will happen, even when everything looks dire… instead of pre-emptively killing each other.",

            "dogs-battle-start": "So… are you coming with us ? It's going to be dangerous down here. We could use the help. The townfolks will be sure to find ways of repaying the favour. ",
            "dogs-get-reward": "Sure thing. You did a good job down there. Here's your reward.",
            "dogs-mediate-trade": "I spoke to their leader. They want peace. They're willing to trade for the resources underground, as long as the tunnels remains theirs to use.",

            "dogs-mediation-reentry": "Yes ? Anything new to report about those diamod dogs ?",
            "dogs-mediation-start": "We need to talk about the diamond dogs living in the dumps.",
            "dogs-negociate-cancel": "Actually, nothing's new. I'll come back later.",
            "dogs-negociation-accept": "I agree, and I'm glad we can find a peaceful resolution… though I would've liked a less exclusive kind of agrement. I'll personally make sure everyone's aware to avoid the diamond dogs tunnels and their surroundings. Tell the diamond dogs they don't have to worry about us anymore.",
            "dogs-negociation-accept-trade": "Great ! That sounds exactly like what we need to ensure a lasting peace between our two groups ! We'll need each other, and with time, we'll grow to trust one another. You may tell them to expect myself and Midnight Facade sometime soon. We'll discuss about what we can provide each other. I'm sure it'll work out just fine. Thank you for making this possible !",
            "dogs-negociation-disappeared": "I would consider this… but I can hardly believe that the dog's being around, and the fact that scavengers have been disappearing lately would be unrelated. I want to know what happened to them. As long as they're alive, I'm willing to hear the dogs' claims. But I want to see these ponies come back here alive first.",
            "dogs-negociation-failed": "Do they really now ? Have you been leading me on this whole time ? A scavenger came back moments ago, told me he'd been attacked by a giant dog. These diamond dogs clearly cannot be trusted around the town. We need to drive them away.",
            "dogs-negociation-hostages": "Not yet. That sounds like a fair proposal: after all, they have as much right as we do to live here. But they are still holding hostages some of scavengers friends. Go back to the diamond dogs and give them my terms: I won't accept any negociations until their prisoners have made their way here, safe and sound.",
            "dogs-negociation-killed": "No way. They murdered peaceful scavengers. We can't trust these dogs. At this point, one of our two groups will have to move away from this place. And I'll make sure my folks won't lose their home… never again. We'll take care of these dogs, and we'll take care of them right now.",
            "dogs-negociation-trigger-ask-hostage-release": "I'll see what I can do.",
            "dogs-warpath": "I see. It's a pity about those diamond dogs, but we can't leave these lands, and we can't let them hurt our people. We have to confront them… and fight them. I'll round up the townfolks.",
            "dogs-warpath-trigger": "I guess it has to be done, then.",
            "dogs/deal-accepted": "Good news ! Our community decided to accept the diamond dog's proposal.<br>\nI'd like for you to give them the news. We're ready to welcome their representative, right here, so we can discuss further about our common future !",
            "dogs/deal-rejected": "We commonly decided not to get involved with the diamond dogs any further. We don't trust them, and they don't trust us. There's no point making deals with people who don't trust.",
            "dogs/deal-war": "The people decided. We are going to kick us some diamond dog butts. It's the only way to guarantee our safety.",
            "dogs/negociations/about-assembly": "The assembly begins everyday at 9pm and ends at 11pm. You're free to come if you want, we do it right here at the inn.",
            "dogs/negociations/captives-not-freed": "Oh yeah ? As long as I haven't seen my scavengers pals back here safe and sound, I won't discuss about anything with these scumbags.",
            "dogs/negociations/entry": "I'm listening. What's new ?",
            "dogs/negociations/start-step-1": "You want us to speak with those who abducted our friends ? What next, we serve them tea and cookies ?",
            "dogs/negociations/start-step-2": "So, let's admit it wasn't an act of war. They still abducted our pals. Don't you see the kind of precedent it sets ?",
            "dogs/negociations/start-step-3": "Well. What are they asking for anyway, these diamond dogs ?",
            "dogs/negociations/start-step-3-2": "They want exclusive access to the tunnels ? As if that space belonged to them ? No one has the authority to ask that of anyone. What next ? A flag, an anthem, a tax on pickaxes ? We don't assign bits of lands, over here.",
            "dogs/negociations/start-step-4": "Anyway, that goes against everything we stand for. No borders, no fences. And now we're supposed to make the underground off-limits ?",
            "dogs/negociations/step-1-angered": "Oh yeah ? And if it was your own family, who got trapped underground, would you still be arguing on how things are relative ?",
            "dogs/negociations/step-1-convinced": "Hm. If they freed them without being threatened to do it, then they're at least a little bit smart.",
            "dogs/negociations/step-1-neutral": "Hm… that, I can understand. But fear is an enemy of reason, and it will be difficult to build up a relationship with people that are not reasonable.",
            "dogs/negociations/step-2-angered": "So you're justifying their violence now ? How about you also sell your them your butthole ?",
            "dogs/negociations/step-2-convinced": "I guess… I'm usually not strong on diplomacy. But you're right about one thing: better talk to each other than murder each other. ",
            "dogs/negociations/step-2-neutral": "Yeah, it didn't take a turn for the worse, this time. I'm worried about the next time.",
            "dogs/negociations/step-3-angered": "Oh, I'd like to see them try. I'll make myself a neat necklace with their fangs.",
            "dogs/negociations/step-3-convinced": "Avert rather than avenge, huh ? Yeah, that tracks. If we can prevent a foal from getting murdered down there… yeah, it's worth taking a vote.",
            "dogs/negociations/step-3-neutral": "And because they've been here longer, nopony should be able to settle there, let alone walk around ? That's not the way these things should work.",
            "dogs/negociations/step-4-angered": "You call them feral beasts, and you'd have us negociate with them ? You're not right in the head.",
            "dogs/negociations/step-4-convinced": "A good neighbor agreement, huh… yeah, I like the ring off it much better.",
            "dogs/negociations/step-4-neutral": "Hm… yeah… I suppose… it amounts to proving them right, though.",
            "dogs/negociations/step-5-angered": "I think you've said enough. I'm more convinced than ever. The diamond dogs are a threat, and we'll never be safe as long as they're at our doors. I'm going to gather the volunteers, and we're going to kick their asses.",
            "dogs/negociations/step-5-convinced": "You did well making your point. I'll bring it up at the next communal assembly, and I'll try to get the people's agreement. Talk to me afterwards.",
            "dogs/negociations/step-5-neutral": "Well. I'm not making any promises… the community will decide. I'll bring up the topic at the next communal assembly.",
            "dogs/negociations/wait-assembly": "We'll talk about this after the assembly. Our folks still need to take a decision.",

            "job-haunted-heap": "I might've a job for you. Lately, some of the scavengers who rented rooms in my inn have went in the dumps and haven't been coming back from there. This is unusual, and it'll be bad for the town's reputation if people just go missing.",

I can only guess that you're lying through your teeth. It wasn't enough that you couldn't save one of them, you had to try and squeeze a reward out of me. I'm very disappointed… please, just go away…",

            "town-leader-midnight-hint": "What ? And who the hell told you that ?<br>It was Midnight Facade, wasn't it ? <i>[He laughs]</i> Of course it was ! Who else ?<br>Look, Midnight hasn't been here for so long. She's a good fellow, and she's awesome at what she does for us. She doesn't really believe in our way of life… but we'll grow on her ! We already have, just a little bit ! You should've been here when we convinced her to open shop here ! Said she preferred growing old rather than dying along with a bunch of hopeless daydreamers.<br>Yet we're still here, and so is she. We grew on her. And we'll grow on her some more. And on you too, hopefully ! We have that kind of effect on people !",
            "town-leader-more": "Oh, come on… I'm being honest with you. Everyone's equal, and no one bosses anyone else around. I'm not trying to convince you that everything's always smooth and dandy, but we make it work.",
            "town-story": "Nothing much to say about it. This used to be a dump before the war. There's still plenty of scrap laying around. Ponies have come here looking for parts ever since the megaspells hit.<br>Then I came around. Built this house. It wasn't always this big but… the occasional scavengers started visiting me, stayed the night, tasted my cooking. So I made it bigger, turned my house into an inn. Then people started settling around. We shared our stuff, worked all day long, ate at the same table told each other stories at night.<br>Now, merchants regularly come trade with us, and we have an intendant to handle our supplies. There's even that steel ranger unicorn who fixes our stuff… when he's around !"
