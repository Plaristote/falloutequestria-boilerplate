            "ask-about-leader": "So, who's in charge over here ?",
            "ask-about-leader-contest": "Funny thing about this. I asked the same question somewhere else, and I've been told <i>you</i> were the boss.",
            "ask-about-leader-insist": "Suuure... and within this big family of yours, who would you say is the mother ?",
            "ask-job": "Is there anything for me to do around here ?",
            "ask-meal": "I'm starving ! What's on the menu ?",

            "battle-reward-negociate": "Make that 200 caps and I'm in.",
            "dogs-battle-ask-reward": "I guess that's fair... you're just an outsider. I can round up a 100 caps.",
            "dogs-battle-ask-reward-fail": "No. I value my comrade's life above all else, but I seriously doubt your help will be worth that much caps. I'll pay you a hundred and that's final. So, are we going ?",
            "dogs-battle-ask-reward-improved": "Okay. 200 caps it is. But you better make yourself worth it.",
            "dogs-battle-canceled": "Really ? That's good news, I guess... it's a pity for those diamond dogs. But at least we no longer face impending doom, so... thank you !",
            "dogs-battle-impossible-all-dead": "Don't bother. You're fine. I already wiped out the diamond dogs.",
            "dogs-battle-join-gladly": "Sure ! I'd never miss an opportunity to kick some asses !",
            "dogs-battle-join-money": "I'm not putting my flank out there unless it pays the bills. How much are you ready to pay ?",
            "dogs-battle-join-reward": "You've got yourself a deal. Let's go already !",
            "dogs-battle-peace": "I really don't think that's a good way to solve this problem...",
            "dogs-battle-peacemaking": "They're a constant threat to us. They could jump at us when we're least expecting. We're not really figthers over here, and we probably can't afford to lose the initiative. Why should we let them decide who gets to live here, after all the effort we spent settling ?",
            "dogs-battle-peacemaking-appeased": "When you put it like that... I guess I don't really want this town's history tainted with blood. This place should be about building a confortable future... we'll probably regret building it on the mistakes of the past. Ok. We won't attack them. Still, I'll see if we can start some kind of night patrol or something... we can't drop our guard.",
            "dogs-battle-peacemaking-come": "On second thought, you might be right. Alright, I'm going to help you. Let's go.",
            "dogs-battle-peacemaking-convince": "You don't even know if they'll ever try anything against you. You really are going to slaughter an entire village, on the chance that they might slaugther you first ?",
            "dogs-battle-peacemaking-convince-success": "I understand. They're dangerous. But you don't even know if they'll ever try anything against you. You would be slaughtering an entire village, on the chance that they might slaugther you first. I'm guessing that might be all this whole megaspell hellhole around us started in the first place... maybe it's time to start trusting that good things will happen, even when everything looks dire... instead of pre-emptively killing each other.",
            "dogs-battle-peacemaking-exit": "If you say so... but I won't be joining the bloodbath.",
            "dogs-battle-peacemaking-not-appeased": "If that's what it take to ensure my folks' safety, then yes. We'll do it, and we'll wear that burden. I've done enough running away in my life. This time, I'll face the danger head-on and make sure my people will make it.",
            "dogs-battle-reject": "I'll sit this one out. But hey, I'll be cheering for you ! Go get'em ! Yay !",
            "dogs-battle-reject-alt": "I'm sorry, but no, I won't sully my hooves with that blood.",
            "dogs-battle-start": "So... are you coming with us ? It's going to be dangerous down here. We could use the help. The townfolks will be sure to find ways of repaying the favour. ",
            "dogs-get-reward": "Sure thing. You did a good job down there. Here's your reward.",
            "dogs-mediate-trade": "I spoke to their leader. They want peace. They're willing to trade for the resources underground, as long as the tunnels remains theirs to use.",
            "dogs-mediate-war": "The diamond dogs are on the path of war. They intend to chase you from the dumps.",
            "dogs-mediate-zone": "Their leader told me that the peace can be kept as long as you agree not to enter their tunnels.",
            "dogs-mediation-entry": "Sure, I'm always open to... wait, what ? Diamond what now ? Living where ? That's the first time I ever heard about this ! What's going on ?",
            "dogs-mediation-reentry": "Yes ? Anything new to report about those diamod dogs ?",
            "dogs-mediation-start": "We need to talk about the diamond dogs living in the dumps.",
            "dogs-negociation-accept": "I agree, and I'm glad we can find a peaceful resolution... though I would've liked a less exclusive kind of agrement. I'll personally make sure everyone's aware to avoid the diamond dogs tunnels and their surroundings. Tell the diamond dogs they don't have to worry about us anymore.",
            "dogs-negociation-accept-trade": "Great ! That sounds exactly like what we need to ensure a lasting peace between our two groups ! We'll need each other, and with time, we'll grow to trust one another. You may tell them to expect myself and Midnight Facade sometime soon. We'll discuss about what we can provide each other. I'm sure it'll work out just fine. Thank you for making this possible !",
            "dogs-negociation-disappeared": "I would consider this... but I can hardly believe that the dog's being around, and the fact that scavengers have been disappearing lately would be unrelated. I want to know what happened to them. As long as they're alive, I'm willing to hear the dogs' claims. But I want to see these ponies come back here alive first.",
            "dogs-negociation-failed": "Do they really now ? Have you been leading me on this whole time ? A scavenger came back moments ago, told me he'd been attacked by a giant dog. These diamond dogs clearly cannot be trusted around the town. We need to drive them away.",
            "dogs-negociation-hostages": "Not yet. That sounds like a fair proposal: after all, they have as much right as we do to live here. But they are still holding hostages some of scavengers friends. Go back to the diamond dogs and give them my terms: I won't accept any negociations until their prisoners have made their way here, safe and sound.",
            "dogs-negociation-killed": "No way. They murdered peaceful scavengers. We can't trust these dogs. At this point, one of our two groups will have to move away from this place. And I'll make sure my folks won't lose their home... never again. We'll take care of these dogs, and we'll take care of them right now.",
            "dogs-negociation-trigger-ask-hostage-release": "I'll see what I can do.",
            "dogs-warpath": "I see. It's a pity about those diamond dogs, but we can't leave these lands, and we can't let them hurt our people. We have to confront them... and fight them. I'll round up the townfolks.",
            "dogs-warpath-trigger": "I guess it has to be done, then.",
            "done-asking": "That's all I wanted to know. Bye !",
            "entry": "Hi there ! What can I do you for ? Fancy a meal ?",
            "get-battle-reward": "We've chased away the diamond dogs. So, about that reward ?",
            "introduction": "Hi ! It's a pleasure seeing a new face around here ! The name's {{npc}}, and I'm the town's cook and innkeeper. What can I do you for ?",
            "job-find-helpful": "Actually, something came up lately. The little Helpful disappeared, and his parents are worried sick. Maybe you could reach out to them.",
            "job-haunted-heap": "I might've a job for you. Lately, some of the scavengers who rented rooms in my inn have went in the dumps and haven't been coming back from there. This is unusual, and it'll be bad for the town's reputation if people just go missing.",
            "job-haunted-heap-accept-reward": "It's a pleasre doing business with you.",
            "job-haunted-heap-details": "There's this rumor about a part in the dump where you can sometimes hear weird noises... the local don't really go there : superstitions and all. But outsiders would probably go there, and as it happens, outsiders are the only ones disappearing. It's located somewhere in the south-western part of the dumps, which you will find north from here.",
            "job-haunted-heap-on-report": "Yes, the missing scavengers went by the inn, I've been able to talk to them about this whole ordeal ! Anyway, good job finding them ! I knew I could put my faith in you, I had a good feeling about you ! Thanks to you, the town's reputation is saved ! Here's your reward <i>[he hoofs you a small pouch full of bottle caps]</i>.",
            "job-haunted-heap-on-report-lie": "Oh yes ? It's weird. I'm pretty sure this would've been the first place they would've come to had you saved them. I can only guess that you're lying through your teeth. It wasn't enough that you couldn't save one of them, you had to try and squeeze a reward out of me. I'm very disappointed... please, just go away...",
            "job-haunted-heap-on-report-partial-success": "Yes, some of the missing scavengers went by the inn, I've been able to talk to them about this whole ordeal ! It's a pity they didn't all make it out alive... anyway, good job finding them. Here's your reward <i>[he hoofs you a small pouch full of bottle caps]</i>.",
            "job-haunted-heap-reject-reward": "Keep the reward. I don't need the money, I'm just glad I could help.",
            "job-haunted-heap-report": "Yes ? Have you found out anything new ?",
            "job-haunted-heap-report-trigger": "About the missing scavangers...",
            "job-haunted-heap-reporting-dogs": "Really ? What happened to them ? Are they still alive ?",
            "job-haunted-heap-tell-about-dogs": "I know what happened to the missing scavengers.",
            "job-haunted-heap-tell-about-saved": "I rescued the missing scavengers.",
            "just-passing-by": "I'm just passing by. See you later.",
            "meal-reject": "Forget it. I'm not actually that hungry.",
            "menu": "We have moss salad, moss stew, and more moss salad ! Plenty of moss around these parts, but once you've had some, you won't ever want anything else !",
            "no-jobs": "Nope, you've cleared all the jobs available for now !",
            "nothing-new": "Actually no. I'll get back to it.",
            "report-dog-captives": "There's a pack of diamond dogs living in the dumps. They want to keep the secret of their tunnels, and hold captive anyone who stumbles upon them.",
            "report-dog-hostages": "They're being held hostages by a bunch of diamond dogs. They want you out of their territory.",
            "take-meal": "I'll be the judge of that. Gimme both, at this point I could eat anything anyway.",
            "take-meal-moss-salad": "Give me some of that moss salad.",
            "take-meal-stew": "I'll take the stew.",
            "town-index": "What can't I tell you about this town ? I've been there since the very beginning. Built this house with my own hooves. What else are you curious about ?",
            "town-leader": "Right here ? I'm in charge. You're in my home ! Watch yourself, heh heh ! But if you wanted to know who's in charge of running the town... well, the town pretty much runs itself.<br>It's a small town, you see ? There's no need for formalities. We're kind of a big family.",
            "town-leader-midnight-hint": "What ? And who the hell told you that ?<br>It was Midnight Facade, wasn't it ? <i>[He laughs]</i> Of course it was ! Who else ?<br>Look, Midnight hasn't been here for so long. She's a good fellow, and she's awesome at what she does for us. She doesn't really believe in our way of life... but we'll grow on her ! We already have, just a little bit ! You should've been here when we convinced her to open shop here ! Said she preferred growing old rather than dying along with a bunch of hopeless daydreamers.<br>Yet we're still here, and so is she. We grew on her. And we'll grow on her some more. And on you too, hopefully ! We have that kind of effect on people !",
            "town-leader-more": "Oh, come on... I'm being honest with you. Everyone's equal, and no one bosses anyone else around. I'm not trying to convince you that everything's always smooth and dandy, but we make it work.",
            "town-story": "Nothing much to say about it. This used to be a dump before the war. There's still plenty of scrap laying around. Ponies have come here looking for parts ever since the megaspells hit.<br>Then I came around. Built this house. It wasn't always this big but... the occasional scavengers started visiting me, stayed the night, tasted my cooking. So I made it bigger, turned my house into an inn. Then people started settling around. We shared our stuff, worked all day long, ate at the same table told each other stories at night.<br>Now, merchants regularly come trade with us, and we have an intendant to handle our supplies. There's even that steel ranger unicorn who fixes our stuff... when he's around !"
